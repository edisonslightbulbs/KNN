#### Example use for this tiny knn lib based on [nanoflann](https://github.com/jlblancoc/nanoflann)

Massive thanks to [Jose](https://github.com/jlblancoc) for sharing this adaptation of [flann](https://github.com/mariusmuja/flann) üëèüçªüçª

In this illustration, we find the 5th nearest neighbor of the first five points (i.e., given a set of 3D points). Typically, the Nth nearest neighbor of each point to every other point needs to be computed: an expensive operation even with nannoflann's impressive optimizations.

    int main()
    {
        int k = 5;                                // K value
        std::vector<float> knnQuery;              // L2 distances to Kth neighbours
        std::vector<Point> points = readPoints(); // get points
        const int indexes = 5;                    // arbitrary val for illustration

        for (int i = 0; i < indexes; i++) {
            int indexOfQueryPoint = i;

            std::vector<std::pair<Point, float>> nn
                    = knn::compute(points, k, indexOfQueryPoint);

            /* nanoflann uses squared L2 distances */
            knnQuery.push_back( std::sqrt(nn[i].second));

            std::cout << "#" << i << ",\t"
                      << "dist: " << std::sqrt(nn[i].second) << ",\t"
                      << "point: (" << nn[i].first.m_xyz[0] << ", "
                      << nn[i].first.m_xyz[1] << ", " << nn[i].first.m_xyz[2]
                      << ") " << std::endl;
        }

        /* sort the L2 distances and output them for plotting */
        std::sort(knnQuery.begin(), knnQuery.end(), std::greater<>());
        const std::string file = pwd() + "/knn.csv";
        std::cout << file << std::endl;
        write(knnQuery, file);
        return 0;
    }

The `Point` Class used in this example given below:

    struct Point {
    std::array<float, 3> m_xyz {};
    Point(float x, float y, float z)
    : m_xyz({ x, y, z })
    {
    }
    };

The `readPoints` and `writePoints` functions are adaptable implementations and therefore left out.
